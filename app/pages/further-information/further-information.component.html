  <h2>Why we need the .htaccess file in a production environment</h2>
  <p>
    When you deploy your build to a production server without an .htaccess file you will drive into an issue: As soon as
    you
    reload your app you'll get an <code>404 HTTP Code</code> or an <code>500 HTTP Code</code> because the server can not
    resolve your Angular routes. These routes are managed by Angular on the client-side and not on the server-side
    (anyway SEO for Angular generated pages do not work for the same reason. If you need SEO, see <a
    href="https://angular.io/guide/universal">Angular Universal</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    This issue only happens if you are using the <code>PathLocationStrategy</code>, because it adds a rout as an URI.
    Angular supports two different <a href="https://angular.io/guide/router">location strategies</a>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>PathLocationStrategy — the default "HTML5 pushState" style. (example: <code>http://example.com/page1</code>)
    </li>
    <li>HashLocationStrategy — the "hash URL" style. (example: <code>http://example.com/#/page1</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The .htaccess Generator fixes this redirection issue by default. If you are using the HashLocationStrategy and you
    want to use other features of the .htaccess generator, it doesn't harm to keep the fix.
  </p>

  <h2>Words of advice</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      If you have access to the Apache server configuration I recommend you to insert the options there instead of using
      a <code>.htaccess</code> file. That way it improves the page speed because the server can apply the options and
      redirection right away. If you prefer the easy way, you can still use the .htaccess file.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always do an backup before changing your <code>.htaccess</code> file. If something went wrong, you can easily go
      back.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>The pages of my angular app are not indexed by search engines (e.g. Google). Why?</b>
      <p>
        <i>Your app and it's content is generated by Angular on the client-side. Search engines can only access the meta
          tags of the index.html file. If you want to create an SEO friendly Angular app, see <a
